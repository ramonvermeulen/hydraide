	// Note:
	// The function uses read-transaction (RLock) to ensure multiple read operations can occur simultaneously without blocking each other while preserving data integrity.
	IsExists(key string) bool

	// SortBy... Common Functionality:
	// 1. Each sorting function first locks the beacon instance using the internal mutex `mu` to ensure thread safety during the sorting operation.
	// 2. It then checks if the beacon is ordered (`isOrdered`). If it's not ordered, an error will be returned.
	// 3. Finally, the function uses Go's built-in `sort.Slice()` method to sort the `treasures` slice based on the given attribute.
	//
	// Use Cases:
	// - Dynamic Search Parameters: Allow users to sort results based on their preferred attributes.
	// - Analytics and Reporting: Easily generate sorted lists for further analysis.
	// - Optimized Data Access: Faster retrieval of data due to pre-sorted lists.
	// - Cache Strategy: Facilitate cache eviction strategies by sorting by expiration time.
	//
	// Common Error Handling:
	// - All sorting functions will return an error if the `isOrdered` flag is not set, ensuring uniform error handling across all sorting functions.
	//
	// Performance and Scalability:
	// - Proper implementation of these functions should not introduce significant performance overhead but will increase the codebase's maintainability and readability.

	// Iterate goes through each treasure in the beacon's `treasuresByKeys` map and calls the given `iterFunc` with the treasure object as its parameter. It's designed to provide a unified approach for iterating over all the elements in a beacon instance while ensuring thread safety.
	//
	// How it Works:
	// 1. Locks the beacon instance for reading using the read-transaction (`RLock()`) from the internal mutex `mu` to prevent any writes during the iteration. The read-transaction allows multiple goroutines to read the beacon concurrently.
	// 2. Iterates over the treasures, invoking the provided `iterFunc` on each. If `iterFunc` returns `false`, the iteration will break immediately.
	// 3. Unlocks the beacon instance automatically using `defer`, ensuring that the transaction is released after the function returns.
	//
	// Usage Scenarios:
	// - Bulk Operations: Perform operations like logging, transformations, or validation on all treasures in a beacon.
	// - Analytics: Extract information or statistics about the current state of treasures in the beacon.
	// - Debugging: A convenient way to examine the current elements during debugging sessions.
	//
	// Considerations:
	// - The function is blocking and locks the entire beacon for reading, so consider the performance implications if you have a large number of treasures or if the `iterFunc` performs time-consuming operations.
	// - Use the `Clone` methods if you need to perform iterations without locking the beacon.
	//
	// Concurrency:
	// - Because the function uses a read-transaction, other goroutines can still read the beacon concurrently, but no writes will be allowed during the iteration.
	//
