// ModelCatalogMessages demonstrates a simple socket-like message system powered by HydrAIDE.
//
// This model is ideal for scenarios where multiple services need to publish messages
// to a central Swamp (data vault), and one or more clients — such as WebSocket frontends —
// need to receive those messages in real time.
//
// It can also be used for microservice-to-microservice communication,
// where services emit and listen to domain events via HydrAIDE.
//
// In our monorepo architecture, models like this are shared across services.
// Each model is either "thin" (self-contained) or wrapped by a service layer
// for more advanced business logic.
//
// This design makes the model reusable across services, without requiring each one
// to implement custom socket or broker logic. HydrAIDE becomes the central message broker,
// automatically handling persistence (if needed), subscriptions, delivery, and cleanup.
//
// ▶️ This example specifically demonstrates how to use the **Subscription** API of HydrAIDE,
// including live data streaming, event filtering, and optional message cleanup.
//
// See the `Subscribe()` method for a complete, idiomatic implementation.

	// Unique message ID

	// It should already be a serialized JSON string, so no need to marshal it again.
	Message string `hydraide:"value"`

	// Timestamp when the message was created
	CreatedAt time.Time `hydraide:"createdAt"`

	// Optional expiration timestamp.
	// Once this is passed, the message can be deleted from the Swamp automatically.
	ExpireAt time.Time `hydraide:"expireAt"`
}

// Other microservices that subscribe to this Swamp will receive the message instantly.

// Subscribe connects to the Swamp and listens for new messages in real time.
// Callback is invoked only when a new message arrives.
// The subscription ends when the provided context is cancelled.
// This is useful for live dashboards, inter-service events, or pushing updates to UIs.
//
// If getExistingData=true, HydrAIDE will also deliver already-existing Treasures
// in the Swamp as if they were new – useful when you want both history and live updates.
//
// ⚠️ Note: You must pass a **non-pointer** empty struct of the same type to receive events.

	// If `getExistingData` is set to true, HydrAIDE will deliver all existing Treasures
	// currently stored in the Swamp as if they were new events — before it starts streaming new ones.
	//
	// This is useful when you expect that some messages might already exist,
	// and want to process them immediately, without performing a separate Read() query.
	// It gives you both historical and live messages in a single call.

	// ⚠️ Important: The model type passed to Subscribe (e.g. ModelCatalogMessages{}) must be:
	// - a non-pointer struct (not *ModelCatalogMessages)
	// - matching the actual type stored in the Swamp
	// HydrAIDE will use this as the target type for decoding event payloads.

	// The provided callback function is invoked whenever a new message (or "Treasure") is received.

		// - StatusNew:            A new Treasure was added to the Swamp.
		// - StatusModified:       An existing Treasure was updated.
		// - StatusNothingChanged: The Treasure was re-broadcasted without changes (e.g. on hydration).
		// - StatusDeleted:        The Treasure was deleted from the Swamp.

		// Based on this, you can apply different logic — e.g. render, patch, ignore, or cleanup

		// Cast the received model to the expected type.

			// Optionally, you can delete the message from the Swamp immediately after calling `callbackFunc(message)`.
			// Doing so will trigger a new event (StatusDeleted), which will also be delivered to this subscription.

			// This is useful when you want to implement auto-cleanup after successful message processing.
