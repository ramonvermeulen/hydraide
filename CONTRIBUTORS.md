# 🤝 HydrAIDE Contributors – Help Build the Engine of a New Era

HydrAIDE isn't just another database.
It's an **Adaptive Intelligent Data Engine (AIDE)**, something that blends search, memory, and messaging into a real-time, ephemeral, and surprisingly elegant system.

And now, we're looking for the kind of people who get excited about building the weird stuff that ends up changing everything.

## 🌌 Why You Might Want to Join Us

Ever get frustrated with tools that:

* Force you to define schemas before you know the shape of your logic?
* Need to run background daemons just to feel alive?
* Eat up memory just sitting there idle?
* Depend on brokers to be "reactive"?

Then yeah. You might be one of us.

> HydrAIDE was built by asking: *What would data look like if it was designed for AI-native, multi-core, real-time systems from day zero?*

The engine is ready. Now we’re building SDKs.
We’re not looking for rockstars. We’re looking for **curious**, **intentional** devs who want to build something that actually matters.

> 🙋‍♀️ **New to SDKs?**
> That’s fine. If you’ve built APIs, CLIs, or just like clean, expressive code, you’ll be right at home. We’ll guide you through.

## 🧭 What You'll Actually Do

We’re building official SDKs across multiple languages.
Each one should be:

* Idiomatic
* Clean
* Inspired by our Go reference SDK

You're not just wrapping endpoints. You're translating a new kind of intelligence into the language you love.

| 💻 Language | 🔗 Repo       | 🛠️ Status  | 📝 Notes                 |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Go          | `hydraidego`  | ✅ Ready     | Your blueprint. Dive in. |
| Node.js     | `hydraidejs`  | 🧪 Planning | First-contributor ready  |
| Python      | `hydraidepy`  | 🧠 Design   | Great for scripts, ML    |
| Rust        | `hydraiders`  | 🧠 Design   | Zero-cost abstractions   |
| Java        | `hydraidejv`  | 🧠 Design   | Backend-scale strength   |
| C# / .NET   | `hydraidecs`  | 🧠 Design   | Unity, services, etc.    |
| C++         | `hydraidecpp` | 🧠 Design   | Bare metal control       |
| Kotlin      | `hydraidekt`  | 🧠 Design   | Android + server blend   |
| Swift       | `hydraidesw`  | 🧠 Design   | Native Apple stack       |

> Want to build one in a language that’s not listed? Cool. You're officially a pioneer.

## 🔧 How to Contribute

You’ll be starting from:

* A production-grade Go SDK
* Real systems using HydrAIDE
* A clean gRPC interface

So you won’t be guessing. You’ll be translating proven power into new stacks.

What you might work on:

* Wrap the HydrAIDE API idiomatically
* Translate key helper utils (like struct <-> key/value converters)
* Create usable examples
* Push edge cases to test robustness
* Improve docs, onboarding, and tests
* Wire up real-time subscriptions
